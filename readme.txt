How to play
	In performance interface(MVP)
		click the fader at the bottom of the screen to switch between songs
		note: only when two channels are both cued, can a switch happen
		a switch can gain you a higher score if it is valid, or say, proper
		for example, a switch between a drop and an intro, a drop and a drop, a 		drop and a break, a verse and a buildup etc are valid, but a switch 			between drop and verse, buildup and intro etc. is invalid, which will make 		your score increase slower(or stop)
		
		the score is calculated by taking the average rate of satisfaction of 			everyone in the crowd, who have a respond to every operation done by the 		dj to change their own rating. If their rating is below 30, they will 			leave the dance floor.

		other type of operation can also increase people's rating, including valid 		equalization and valid Mcing. Valid eq should happen inside verse, 			buildup, drop and break, valid Mcing should happen inside verse, buildup, 		and drop. Note: there should not be more than two Mcing or Eq in one song,		if you break the limit, the crowd would not like it.
	You have a maximum playtime of 5 songs, the djing also automatically ends when 		song is played till the very end.
	In the studio:
		In career mode, player can schedule their everyday events inside the month
		The they can click the silver button on the buttom right corner to move to 		the next day. The gay follows the scheduled events and change player's 			money, popularity, skills accordingly.
		(the implementation of the rest didn't complete yet)
		Player can sign up to a record company when they have enough popularity,
		When they are signed up, they have better income, but their have less free 		time, since they need at least 5 days of rest a month, but the company 			will schedule about 10 days for the player, which they can't change.

		You can also recruit members to your team to improve scores in a 			performance, including VJ, Lights control. You can also buy tracks from 		ghost producers to release if you don't have enough tracks to release in 		your own music library(if you signed up but don't release on time, you 			will get punishment)

		you can also improve your gears in the studio via purchasing, which will 		provide you with a better music score in a production.
